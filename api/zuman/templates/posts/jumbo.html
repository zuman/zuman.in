        <p class="lead">This tool helps you to create an in-clause for a list of input separated by new line characters.
        </p>
        <p>This in-clause is used by most Database Administrators and Developers for their sql queries.</p>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <p>Input list =></p>
        <p>abc<br>xyz</p>
        <p>Output In-clause => in ('abc','xyz')</p>
        <p>Note: This tool also accounts for Oracle database's 1000 entry limit for a clause. So if you input more
            than a 1000 entries, they will be divided in sections of 1000s.</p>
